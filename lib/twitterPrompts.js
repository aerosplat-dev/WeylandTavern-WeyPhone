const SHARED_FRAMING = `${SHARED_FRAMING_PREAMBLE}
- Use "- " (a markdown bullet) to start every individual post.
- Every post MUST end with a stat block in this exact format:
  "{likes:N retweets:N views:N}" — three whole numbers, no commas/abbreviations (e.g. "views:1200"
  not "views:1.2K"), realistic for a small university social app (most posts: single or low double
  digit likes, views usually higher than likes, retweets usually lower than likes).
- Every post MUST start with the poster's handle in square brackets, like "[@codewolf] post text
  here {likes:12 retweets:2 views:340}".
- A retweet should read: "[@handle] 🔁 Retweeted from @otherhandle: the original post text
  {likes:N retweets:N views:N}" — the stats belong to the retweeting post, not the original.
- Do not use any HTML tags or inline styling — plain markdown only.
- Keep each post to 1-3 sentences.

 * Weyland Dining Services) — every other account either has a real World Info entry that the
 * existing tethered WI scan (index.js's resolveWorldInfoTetheredForMainChat) picks up automatically
 * once the account's own name/handle appears in the prompt text, or is grounded well enough by its
 * name alone. Explicitly excludes Red Lantern, Black Barrel, and Mama's Den — not businesses that
 * would have an online presence, per the operator's own direction.

Generate content for "${character.name}"'s [${character.handle}] Twitter profile — a scrollable
list of ONLY this account's own tweets and retweets. Do not generate posts from anyone else.

## BIO
Write ONE short bio line (under 100 characters) for this account's own Twitter bio — the tagline
that sits right under the profile name and handle. Some accounts take theirs seriously (a real,
straightforward description), others just put something funny or random — pick whichever fits this
account's personality. Put ONLY the bio text on this line, nothing else before or after it.

## POSTS
6-10 posts and/or retweets, all from ${character.name} [${character.handle}] only.
Twitter here is about standalone posts — personal thoughts, announcements, life updates, hot
takes — not conversation. These posts should each stand on their own, not read like one side of a
back-and-forth. Avoid writing these like a live group-chat reply thread, and avoid an
anonymous-sounding confession or explicit rant — these are public posts under
${character.name}'s own name, so keep them a personal broadcast, not a conversation or an
anonymous vent. Stay consistent with what's established below.

Generate content for the Weyland University Twitter main feed, as it would appear to {{user}}
scrolling their timeline.

## FEED
Exactly {{random::2::3::4}} of the posts in this feed MUST be from PSA/business accounts (see the
list below) — pick which accounts post at random each time, prioritizing whichever would be most
relevant to the current roleplay context. Fill the rest (aim for 10-14 posts total) with a variety
of individual Weyland characters (see the roster below) posting, retweeting, and occasionally
replying.
Twitter here is about standalone posts — personal thoughts, announcements, life updates, hot
takes — not back-and-forth conversation. A Twitter post stands on its own rather than being part
of a live chat exchange; replies/quote-posts are rare and should read as occasional commentary, not
an ongoing back-and-forth. Avoid writing these like a live group-chat reply thread, and avoid an
anonymous-sounding confession or explicit rant — these are public posts under the poster's own
name, so keep them a personal broadcast, not a conversation or an anonymous vent.
