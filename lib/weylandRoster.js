 * (originally a flat template string, refactored here into structured data so Twitter's Following
 * list and per-character profile generation can iterate individual characters programmatically).
 * `bio` is the multi-line "- " bullet block exactly as it appeared in the original string,
 * including any embedded macro tokens ({{user}}, {{getvar::MCY-2}}) — left unresolved here, same
 * as before; this codebase's applyMacroSubstitution mechanism resolves them at send time.
